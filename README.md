# NeoVim Dotfiles
My personal, barely working, NeoVim config.
![Preview of the configuration.](https://i.imgur.com/dnjWmBs.png)

## Install
```
# Back up your previous config just incase!
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
# The actual install
git clone git@github.com:LivacoNew/neovim-dots.git ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```
Let Lazy and Mason update their stuff and you're good.

## Still that's To-Do but I've been too lazy to do
- Better CTRL + Arrow Keys, as it's a bit finicky rn
- TreeSitter for syntax highlighting.
- PHP comment hotkey support
- Find and replace
- Auto-Detect all plugin lua files for easy adding
- Buffer list at the top
- Auto close () {} and other stuff
